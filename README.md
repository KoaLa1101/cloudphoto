To start the project You should have the JDK 17 in terminal
to check it use
```shell
java --version
```
Next command to use it
```shell
mkdir /tmp/cloudphoto
cd /tmp/cloudphoto
```
Due to the large jar file, you should download it from the link and place it in the */tmp/cloudphoto* [APP.JAR](https://dropmefiles.com/2VkWC)
```shell
echo 'alias cloudphoto="java -jar /tmp/cloudphoto/cloudphoto-0.0.1.jar"' >> ~/.bashrc
source ~/.bashrc
```
DONE! You can use program like
```shell
cloudphoto init
```
p.s. recommended use [CONFIG](https://github.com/KoaLa1101/cloudphoto/blob/master/CONFIG)
